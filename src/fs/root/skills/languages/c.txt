C is one of my favorite languages to work with.

I like the simplicity of C. It tests how deep your understanding
of computers and software is. I simply like to play around with raw
pointers which makes me feel like I'm the one incharge.

The things I've built with C:

> ctodo: A todo app in terminal with ncurses interface
> iot-project: Iot based toll collection system where I wrote the code
			   for esp32 in c/c++
