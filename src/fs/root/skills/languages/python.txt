This is actually my first language which I learnt.

I haven't actually built anything big with python but I've learnt
so many things from it.

I've built a pdf analyzer to scrape information from pdf files. It 
basically analyzed the pdf file and extracted data from pdf table
and created a dictionary of the table.
