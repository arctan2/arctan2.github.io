This is one of my favorite programming languages to work with.

I will choose to work with this for backend related tasks or even for 
simple tools. It's actually even simpler than python in my opinion.

The things I've used Go for:

> othello: Real time multiplayer othello game
> ludo-go: Real time multiplayer ludo game with raw tcp connection.
