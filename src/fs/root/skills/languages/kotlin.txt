I used kotlin just because I didn't want to use java.

I don't have much experience in kotlin. I just wanted to try
out android development so I had 2 choices, java and kotlin.
I didn't want to interact with java in any shape or form so I
chose kotlin.

I build a minimal app launcher for android. I'd like to continue
my native app journey when I get a good hardware.
