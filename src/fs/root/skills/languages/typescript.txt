This is the language which I've worked with the most.

I build all the frontend web related things in typescript. I have used it
to build backend API's in the past. But I won't be using it for future projects
as I prefer golang for such tasks.

The things I've used typescript for:

> i-wanna-see-stuff-work: The DSA visualizer
> othello: Real time othello multiplayer game
