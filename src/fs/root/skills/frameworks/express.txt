I started learning express.js when I was first starting
with backend development.

All I knew was javascript back then. So MERN and all was
pretty popular back then. So there were plenty of tutorial
on express. It was a good starting point for a newbie like me.

But I don't use js/ts for backend at all now. But I got the basics
of backend stuff from express.
