The other skills I have are:

> NeoVim: I use nvim as my main editor. I'm intermidiate in vim motions.
		  I can use nvim fairly well although I'm not an expert.

> Linux: I can easily operate in a Linux environment.

> Intuition: Although it's not a skill but I can quickly grasp information
			 and understand context in an environment.
