Quoridor is a real time multiplayer quoridor game written using
enterprise-y tools: spring-boot and angular.

I made this project to learn spring-boot and angular.

It's simple project. I already new the core stuff. It's just
like seeing into other peoples' opinion. I won't be using
this stack for my future projects though. It's decent but
bloated.
