i-wanna-see-stuff-work is a project which started as a sorting visualizer
and went to become a full on data structure and algorithm visualizer.

I wanted to learn advanced data structures and algorithms so instead of
following a tutorial, I decided to make a visualization project out of it.

But there were already so many DSA visualization out there. So to make something
unique I wrote a custom memory allocator visualizer aswell which integrates with
the data structures interactively.
