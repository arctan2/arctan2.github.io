This is a custom app laucher with a very minimalistic UI.

I wanted to try android development one day so I decided to build
a minimalistic app laucher for my android phone.

I used kotlin to code the app as it's more preferred over java by
the android team. So it was a new experience for me in a new language
aswell as a new environment.
