I had to write a bulk email verification tool for a company.
The existing platforms to verify emails are a bit expensive,
so to reduce the cost I made a cli tool to verify emails in bulk.

I used Golang due it's best concurrency model. I was able to verify
emails in bulk now. But I also needed to make a frontend so it's easily
usable for others. So I made a web frontend using Vue and to store the 
data MySql is used.

I made it so that you can see the current verification batches states
update in realtime.
