Hello welcome to my linux like file-system explorer portfolio!

It's just a simple file explorer where you can navigate the files and
directories to go through my portfolio.

This style of interface let's me express myself more content wise, as I need
not worry about the aestheics and just focus on the words.

I don't know why I chose this style of interface. It sounded cool and makes me
look smart(I am not).

I built the json syntax highlighter and collapse thing myself by the way.

**************** Controls ****************

> You can use mouse to navigate

> Use Keyboard arrow keys to move cursor
> `j` -> move cursor down
> `k` -> move cursor up

> Enter to open the file at the cursor
> `q` | `Esc` | `Backspace` -> quit any content window
> `Esc` | `Backspace` | `-` -> go back a directory
