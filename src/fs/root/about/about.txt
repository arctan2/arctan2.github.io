Hi, I'm Prateek.

I'm a curious problem solver who loves to understand how things work
at a deeper level. Technology and science are my passions, shaping 
how I approach life and learning.

Software, to me, is both a tool and a playground, something I use to 
solve problems, explore new ideas, or simply as a mental exercise. 
While I'm well-versed in web technologies, my curiosity drives me to 
explore all aspects of this vast field.

Beyond software, I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and enjoy 
viewing the world through a mathematical and analytical lens. I also 
take an interest in linguistics and philosophy, always eager to explore 
new ideas and perspectives.
