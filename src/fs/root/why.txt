Hello welcome to my terminal emulator portfolio!

It's just a simple terminal emulator where you can navigate the files and
directories to go through my portfolio.

This style of interface let's me express myself more content wise, as I need
not worry about the aestheics and just focus on the words.

I don't know why I chose this style of interface. It sounded cool and makes me
look smart(I am not).

I built the json syntax highlighter and collapse thing myself by the way.
